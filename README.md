🚀 Welcome to JAVA_DSA!
This repository is a personal learning project and a reference guide for core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, all implemented in Java. The primary goal is to provide simple, well-commented, and practical examples that are perfect for:

Students learning DSA for the first time.

Developers looking to refresh their knowledge.

Anyone preparing for technical interviews.

Each implementation is designed for clarity and focuses on the fundamental logic behind each algorithm and data structure.

📚 What's Inside?
This repository provides implementations for a wide range of essential DSA topics.

🔍 Searching Algorithms
Algorithms designed to find an element within a data structure.

Linear Search: A sequential search that checks every element.

Binary Search: An efficient algorithm for searching in sorted arrays.

📊 Sorting Algorithms
A variety of algorithms to arrange elements in a specific order.

Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Selection Sort: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm.

Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

Merge Sort: A highly efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

Quick Sort: A fast, recursive sorting algorithm, also based on divide-and-conquer.

🔗 Linked Lists
Dynamic data structures that consist of a sequence of connected nodes.

Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the sequence.

Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node, allowing for bidirectional traversal.

🥞 Stacks (LIFO)
A "Last-In, First-Out" data structure.

Stack using Array: A static implementation with a fixed-size array.

Stack using Linked List: A dynamic implementation that can grow or shrink.

queuing Queues (FIFO)
A "First-In, First-Out" data structure.

Queue using Array: A static implementation using an array.

Queue using Linked List: A dynamic implementation using a linked list.
