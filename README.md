## 🚀 Welcome to Your DSA Learning Hub!

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and personal reference for core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, all implemented in Java. The primary goal is to provide simple, well-commented, and practical examples perfect for:

-   🎓 **Students** who are learning these concepts for the first time.
-   💻 **Developers** looking to refresh their knowledge and skills.
-   🎯 **Anyone** preparing for technical interviews and coding challenges.

Each implementation is crafted for clarity, focusing on the fundamental logic that powers each topic.

## 📚 What's Inside? A Tour of the Collection

This repository is logically structured to cover the most essential DSA topics.

### 🔍 **Searching Algorithms**
*Efficient methods to locate data within a collection.*
- **Linear Search**: A straightforward sequential search.
- **Binary Search**: A highly efficient logarithmic-time search for **sorted** arrays.

### 📊 **Sorting Algorithms**
*A variety of algorithms to arrange elements in a specific order.*
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place algorithm that divides the list into sorted and unsorted parts.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort**: A powerful, stable, divide-and-conquer algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: A fast, recursive algorithm known for its excellent average-case performance.

### 🔗 **Linked Lists**
*Dynamic data structures composed of a sequence of connected nodes.*
- **Singly Linked List**: Nodes connect in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes connect in both directions, allowing for flexible traversal.

### 🥞 **Stacks (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out)**
*A linear data structure where the last element added is the first one removed.*
- **Implementation with Array**: A static, fixed-size stack.
- **Implementation with Linked List**: A dynamic stack that can grow and shrink.

### 🚶 **Queues (FIFO - First-In, First-Out)**
*A "waiting line" data structure where the first element added is the first one removed.*
- **Implementation with Array**: A static, circular queue to manage space efficiently.
- **Implementation with Linked List**: A flexible, dynamic queue.
