        ## üöÄ Welcome to the Ultimate DSA Learning Hub!

        This repository is a comprehensive guide and personal learning project for mastering core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java. The primary goal is to provide simple, well-commented, and practical examples that are perfect for:

        -   üéì **Students** learning DSA for the first time.
        -   üíª **Developers** looking to refresh their knowledge and skills.
        -   üéØ **Anyone** preparing for technical interviews and coding challenges.

        Each implementation is crafted for clarity, focusing on the fundamental logic that powers each concept.

        ## üìö What's Inside? A Tour of the Collection

        This repository is structured to cover the most essential DSA topics.

        ### üîç **Searching Algorithms**
        *Efficient methods to locate data within a collection.*
        - **Linear Search**: A straightforward sequential search. Best for unsorted lists.
        - **Binary Search**: A highly efficient logarithmic-time search for **sorted** arrays.

        ### üìä **Sorting Algorithms**
        *A variety of algorithms to arrange elements in a specific order.*
        - **Bubble Sort**: A simple, intuitive algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements.
        - **Selection Sort**: An in-place algorithm that divides the list into sorted and unsorted parts.
        - **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, excellent for nearly-sorted data.
        - **Merge Sort**: A powerful, stable, divide-and-conquer algorithm.
        - **Quick Sort**: A fast, recursive algorithm known for its average-case performance.

        ### üîó **Linked Lists**
        *Dynamic data structures composed of a sequence of connected nodes.*
        - **Singly Linked List**: Nodes connect in one direction. Fast for insertions at the head.
        - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes connect in both directions (forward and backward), allowing for flexible traversal.

        ### ü•û **Stacks (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out)**
        *A linear data structure that follows a specific order of operations.*
        - **Implementation with Array**: A static, fixed-size stack.
        - **Implementation with Linked List**: A dynamic stack that can grow and shrink as needed.

        ### üö∂ **Queues (FIFO - First-In, First-Out)**
        *A "waiting line" data structure where the first element added is the first one to be removed.*
        - **Implementation with Array**: A static, circular queue to manage space efficiently.
        - **Implementation with Linked List**: A flexible, dynamic queue.

        ## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository

        1.  **Clone the Repository**:
            ```
            git clone https://github.com/your-username/JAVA_DSA.git
            ```
        2.  **Navigate and Explore**:
            Each algorithm and data structure is in its own directory. Browse to any folder to see the implementation.
            ```
            cd Sorting
            ```
        3.  **Compile & Run**:
            Compile and run any of the Java files to see them in action. Many include a `main` method for demonstration.
            ```
            javac QuickSort.java
            java QuickSort
            ```
